        <div>From a young age I have always been surrounded by people who loved to travel. I have always been told stories about my uncle who has travelled the globe.
            <p>I have heard tales of his travels across Europe, the United states but most stories come from countries in eastern Asia such as China, the Philippines and Thailand.</p> 
            <p>Not only did I grow up hearing of these tales from my uncle, I also have an older sister who has gone travelling at every opportunity.</p>
            <p>She has gone Interrailing across Europe, been to south America and countries in Africa such as Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. As a result I have the travel bug.</div>
