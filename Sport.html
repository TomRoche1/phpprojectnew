            <p>I am a massive lover of all things sport. I follow G.A.A., soccer and rugby very closely and also like to keep up to date with many other sports.
            <p>Personally I play G.A.A and soccer as I have grown up in this environment and it has also grown on  me.</p>
            <p>I am a member of Shamrocks G.A.A. club</p>

            <p>G.A.A. was my first love so I have always leant towards G.A.A. over soccer.</p>
            <p>I play a match every weekend with Shamrocks and train during the week when I can.</p>
            <p>I already have some achievements with the club. Click <a href="cv.html">here</a> to view these achievements on my CV.

            <p>I have many achievements with the club such as a minor football county title and u21 football count title with Shamrocks G.A.A.</p>

            <p>I have also won an u16 league 1 title and first division cup title with Brideview.</p>

            <p>I love going home every weekend to play with my childhood friends who I don't get to see during the week as they are in a different college to me.</p>
            <p>I have always loved playing sports as I love being outside in the open air and I personally find it hard to be idle at home.</p>
            <p>Now that I'm older I see the benefits of being fit and healthy and I know now that it is a good way to be raised.</p>
            <p>Sport has always played a central role for me and it always will and I don't see my love for all things sports dying down any time soon.</p>

        <p>Other than G.A.A, I also follow soccer particularly the premier league.</p>
        <p>I support Arsenal and have attended a few of their games</p>
        <p>I hope to attend more games in the future as it has always been an aspiration of mine to have a season ticket</p>
